## 2026-08-22 — Sprint 1 build

**Context.** This repo started with only a `LICENSE` and a two-line
`README.md`; no team docs, backlog, architecture, or code existed yet, and
no separate BP/PM session was reachable. Built the full Sprint 1 loop
(BP/PM/Code artifacts + implementation) in one pass, playing all three
roles as needed per `TEAM_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`.

**What shipped**

- Process docs: `TEAM_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`, `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`,
  `PROJECT.md`, `BACKLOG.md` (Tasks 1.1–1.6), `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `TESTER.md`.
- `src/generate_blocker_data.py` — stdlib-only generator implementing the
  full domain model in `ARCHITECTURE.md`: teams (internal/external),
  Jira-style issues, Xray-style blocker links with derived category, and
  a tunable percolation-style random-graph process for the blocker edges.
- `tests/test_blocker_generator.py` — 21 automated tests covering every
  item in `TESTER.md` §Automated checks: schema, referential integrity,
  invariants (no self-blocking, no duplicate pairs, category always
  derived not chosen), determinism (same seed → byte-identical CSVs),
  percolation-stats correctness against a hand-built graph, and a CLI
  smoke test. All 21 pass (`pytest tests/ -v`).
- Generated artifacts: `data/teams.csv`, `data/issues.csv`,
  `data/blockers.csv`, `docs/validation_report.md` (default params:
  5 internal + 3 external teams, 25 issues/team, seed 42).

**PM manual spot-check (TESTER.md §Manual spot-checks)** — performed as
part of this session:

- `teams.csv`: 5 internal (Atlas, Nimbus, Forge, Vector, Halcyon) clearly
  distinguishable from 3 external vendors (`Vendor-*`, `Partner-*`). Pass.
- `issues.csv`: spot-checked several rows — `created <= updated` holds,
  `resolved` is set only when `status == Done` and always `>= updated`.
  Pass.
- `blockers.csv`: manually cross-checked several `External` and
  `Inter-Team` rows against the referenced issues' teams in `issues.csv`
  — category always matches the derivation rule. Pass.
- Density sweep (`--blocker-density` 0.1 / 0.35 / 0.8 / 2.0, same seed):
  largest-component fraction moved 2.5% → 2.0% → 24.0% → 77.5% — a clear
  percolation transition as density rises (minor noise at the low end is
  expected sampling variance, not a defect). Pass.

**Sign-off:** Sprint 1 (Tasks 1.1–1.6) meets `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`.
CSVs and `docs/validation_report.md` are ready for BP's narrative
validation.

**Open follow-ups for BP:** review whether the default parameters
(25 issues/team, density 0.35) tell a strong enough "vendor is the
bottleneck" story for a dashboard demo, or whether Sprint 2 should ship a
demo-tuned parameter preset alongside the general-purpose defaults.

## Model & Ethics Checkpoint (2026-08-22)

Models used:
- PM (Claude Haiku 4.5): Sufficient for well-scoped Sprint 1; reassess at Sprint 2 if architecture complexity rises
- Code (Claude Sonnet 5): Appropriate for implementation; no escalation needed yet

Ethics:
- ETHICS_AGREEMENT.md locked in repo, governs all decisions
- Specification-first principle enforced: Code given /specification/ as source of truth
- Single source of truth achieved: archived Code's generic versions, consolidated to /specification/

Observations:
- Miscommunication resolved by consolidation, not conversation
- Model selection deferred to post-Sprint 1 assessment
- Dr. Agile standards repo TBD (post-project action)
